 <p>Smokefreerockquest is New Zealand’s only nationwide, live, original music, youth event. Now in its 33rd year, the series of over 40 events reaches audience numbers in excess of 10,000 every year.

Founded in 1989 by music teachers Glenn Common and Pete Rainey, Smokefreerockquest has now become a New Zealand institution.

Smokefreerockquest aims to motivate young musicians to prove their ability and realise the heights they can reach in their music careers, and to encourage their peers to support original New Zealand music.

 <p>A concert band, variously also called a wind ensemble, symphonic band, wind symphony, wind orchestra, wind band, symphonic winds, symphony band, or symphonic wind ensemble, is a performing ensemble consisting of members of the woodwind, brass, and percussion families of instruments, and occasionally including the double bass or bass guitar. On rare occasions, additional non-traditional instruments may be added to such ensembles such as piano, harp, synthesizer, or electric guitar.

 <p>Stage Challenge® & J Rock™

Civic Theatre, Wednesday, 11 May at 6.30pm

The Junior Campus J Rock entry is called  Pesky Business and is based around the Pied Piper story.  We start with a village market day that gets over-ruled by rodents.  Our ‘Magical’ person comes in and does a deal to get rid of the rodents.  When she returns to get paid, the villagers refuse to pay and so she entices the children to come away with her.  This performance relates to the James Hargest value ‘We are honest’.

The Senior Campus Stage Challenge entry is called Hargie’s Toy Shop. We follow a boy who walks into a toy store and wants to play with dolls but his parents won’t let him. This performance shows the issue of gender stereotyping, and how even in this politically correct modern world we haven’t changed — it’s still not deemed acceptable for boys to play with dolls.
