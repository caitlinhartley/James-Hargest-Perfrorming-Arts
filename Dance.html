 <p>On 21st of May at the Civic Theatre, 51 Senior Campus students represented Hargest at the Southland ShowQuest Regional Festival.

ShowQuest is a nationwide performing arts competition that evolved once Stage Challenge ended. 

It is a celebration of dance and drama, while also allowing opportunities for students to excel in live music and wearable art components too. Most performances tend to tell a narrative that evokes a relevant thematic message or at least a truth about ourselves.

Co-directed by Year 13 students, Brianna Peterson and Anna Morris, and in close collaboration with Mr Oudhoff, the theme was designed to explore what humanity could be capable of in the absence of love. The tale follows protagonist (Brianna Peterson) through her traumatising school life, and a violent family upbringing, while also being burdened by the power of isolation. Ultimately, the theme was designed for audience members to focus on the context of the character and how one action could redefine someone else’s story - particularly during a time of ambiguity and change.

Hargest won 1st place in the Open Category and also received the award for Best Use of Drama. This achievement means that the performance will join the limited National Selection that are eligible for nationwide awards. Both the judges and audience were amazed by the talent onstage - especially by Brianna’s captivating portrayal of a high school outcast. The crew were incredibly efficient and made scene transitions with ease and finesse. The dancers onstage received very high praise and helped carry the core message of the story.

 <p>On 12 May participants met at 7:30am for a day full of dancing, fun and experiencing performances that have been rehearsed and crafted over months.

Each school provided amazing standout performances expressing relevant themes including car accidents, movies, and grief.

Everyone danced their hearts out and showed their passion for their school. Hargest managed to take the win with their emotional performance about sweatshops and consumerism.

The environment was intense and the moment we all realised we won we all expressed extreme emotions, some crying, most screaming.

It was an amazing experience overall.

 <p>Stage Challenge® & J Rock™

Civic Theatre, Wednesday, 11 May at 6.30pm

The Junior Campus J Rock entry is called  Pesky Business and is based around the Pied Piper story.  We start with a village market day that gets over-ruled by rodents.  Our ‘Magical’ person comes in and does a deal to get rid of the rodents.  When she returns to get paid, the villagers refuse to pay and so she entices the children to come away with her.  This performance relates to the James Hargest value ‘We are honest’.

The Senior Campus Stage Challenge entry is called Hargie’s Toy Shop. We follow a boy who walks into a toy store and wants to play with dolls but his parents won’t let him. This performance shows the issue of gender stereotyping, and how even in this politically correct modern world we haven’t changed — it’s still not deemed acceptable for boys to play with dolls.
