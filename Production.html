			<h2>Evita-2019</h2>

 <p>Staging Evita is difficult. It has high challenging musical demands. It chops and changes in its locations. It is virtually carried along by three characters. It requires many strong, plausible, acting characterisations by the supporting company, all of whom are required at some stage to sing and dance. It demands much from your imaginations and the famous concept of suspended disbelief.

Thanks to a brilliant – and I use the adjective with chest-puffed pride – Production Team I believe that we have triumphed in our efforts to stage this demanding and complex musical with an on-stage cast of teenagers.

Mrs Little and assistant, Michael Forde, have worked with an unexpected passion to ensure that the Lloyd Webber music was delivered with spine-tingling mellifluousness.

Ms Maria Alcock and young Mr Brendan Bowie “twinkle-toed” the big production numbers into a kaleidoscope of flashing feet and the Company loved the choreography (which hasn’t always been the case in the past, particularly amongst the males).

Mr Pannett painted a Buenos Aires backdrop of the famous Plaza de Mayo and the Casa Rosada (Pink House or Presidential Palace), as well as creating the (often not attempted) interiors.

Mrs Laura Fryer and her team have had to find a wardrobe that is almost as complex as the plot – and there were some very quick changes involved. Lighting and Sound were completely student driven under the leadership of Ben McIntyre. Last, but certainly not least, Laurel Swan and Caroline Raynes fulfilled the property demands to a professional level – especially those contemporary (1946) Union of Workers placards.

 <p>Brigadoon, Lerner and Loewe’s first great collaboration, is an oldie but remains one of the great musical show biz classics. Furthermore, it has great chorus scenes contrasting with last year’s triumphant Sound of Music, which has really no ensemble requirements. This musical is almost dominated by big scenes and crowded, animated groupings with their rigorous song and dance demands. This is hugely demanding on large numbers of non-speaking roles who must support the principal actors constantly. A failure to do so can destroy such a scene. This was an exceptional chorus, particularly as many are still in Year 11.

Brigadoon’s plot needs no explanation, but it contains all the human elements and emotions within the framework of a mythical highland village in lovely Scotland. Despite the sophistication and occasional cynicism of this cyber age, this cast have become comfortably and delightfully immersed in the magic of this happy good-feeling piece of musical theatre. It’s like the old chap in that TV drink driving advert who volunteers to drive the boys to their required destination and switches the radio to country and western, retorting that “I like it”. And that is exactly what our young company feels about the seventy year old quality piece of showbiz.

 <p>A tuneful, heartwarming story, it is based on the real life story of the Von Trapp Family singers, one of the world's best-known concert groups in the era immediately preceding World War II. Julie Andrews plays the role of Maria, the tomboyish postulant at an Austrian abbey who becomes a governess in the home of a widowed naval captain with seven children, and brings a new love of life and music into the home.

 Michael Forde, your musical direction, choral training and performing as rehearsal pianist, was a hugely demanding ‘first’ for you. You passed with honours (1st class).
 inally, but no less important, there was some ‘tinkering’ with production personnel this year. Mrs Little changed hats and choreographed Brigadoon and wow, it seems that she is as adroit at this as she has been over the recent past successes when she was Musical Director and Orchestral Director.
