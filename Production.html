			<h2>Evita-2019</h2>

 <p>Staging Evita is difficult. It has high challenging musical demands. It chops and changes in its locations. It is virtually carried along by three characters. It requires many strong, plausible, acting characterisations by the supporting company, all of whom are required at some stage to sing and dance. It demands much from your imaginations and the famous concept of suspended disbelief.

Thanks to a brilliant – and I use the adjective with chest-puffed pride – Production Team I believe that we have triumphed in our efforts to stage this demanding and complex musical with an on-stage cast of teenagers.

Mrs Little and assistant, Michael Forde, have worked with an unexpected passion to ensure that the Lloyd Webber music was delivered with spine-tingling mellifluousness.

Ms Maria Alcock and young Mr Brendan Bowie “twinkle-toed” the big production numbers into a kaleidoscope of flashing feet and the Company loved the choreography (which hasn’t always been the case in the past, particularly amongst the males).

Mr Pannett painted a Buenos Aires backdrop of the famous Plaza de Mayo and the Casa Rosada (Pink House or Presidential Palace), as well as creating the (often not attempted) interiors.

Mrs Laura Fryer and her team have had to find a wardrobe that is almost as complex as the plot – and there were some very quick changes involved. Lighting and Sound were completely student driven under the leadership of Ben McIntyre. Last, but certainly not least, Laurel Swan and Caroline Raynes fulfilled the property demands to a professional level – especially those contemporary (1946) Union of Workers placards.

 <p>Skin care is the range of practices that support skin integrity, enhance its appearance and relieve skin conditions. They can include nutrition, avoidance of excessive sun exposure and appropriate use of emollients. Practices that enhance appearance include the use of cosmetics, botulinum, exfoliation, fillers, laser resurfacing, microdermabrasion, peels, retinol therapy and ultrasonic skin treatment. Skin care is a routine daily procedure in many settings, such as skin that is either too dry or too moist, and prevention of dermatitis and prevention of skin injuries.
